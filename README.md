# About Me

I am a Network Software Engineering Specialist at Telstra and a research collaborator with Dr. Sunny Rai (University of Pennsylvania). My research experience and interests include natural language processing, multilingual understanding, figurative language, reasoning, social media analysis, and AI agent development. In industry, I design and deploy production-grade backend and frontend systems, and have been recognized at Telstra for initiative, teamwork, and ownership.

I also build AI-powered applications such as NutriPal and AlarmPal, reflecting my interest in multimodal learning, AI agents, and humanâ€“AI interaction.

I enjoy tackling AI problems that require deep research insight and have the potential for real-world impact, and I continually explore new directions and collaborations that push my understanding forward.

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at Mahindra University, where I was a research assistant under Dr. Sunny Rai.
